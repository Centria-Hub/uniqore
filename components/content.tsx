          <div className='space-y-6'>
            <p>
              To unify the university experience by providing a consistent and
              centralized platform for accessing academic resources. With
              increasing student mobility and academic exchange, many students
              struggle to find essential information across different systems.
              Uniqore aims to bridge that gap by offering a unified hub for
              news, events, and campus updates â€” making it easier for everyone
              to stay informed and engaged, no matter which university they
              belong to.
